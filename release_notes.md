### Mechanics: Accusation Refactor
- **True Deduction**: Accusations no longer involve a "Tell DC" or skill check (Insight vs Deception).
- **Specific Die**: You must simply select the *specific die* you believe was tampered with. If the target used cheat logic on that die, you catch them. If not (even if they cheated on another die), you fail.
- **UI**: Simplified Accusation dialog to focus on die selection.
