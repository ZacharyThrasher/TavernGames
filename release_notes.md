### Goblin Mode: The Chamber Overhaul
- **Goblin**: Forced stage dice (d20 → d12 → d10 → d8 → d6 → d4), then Sudden Death coin.
- **Goblin**: Natural 1 = death (score 0); max roll earns a Boot to break a Hold.
- **Goblin**: Hold is leader‑only; Coward’s Tax (hold before d8) pays 50% of pot.
- **Goblin**: Sudden Death coin repeats until a clear winner; total wipeout keeps pot for House.
- **UI/Docs**: New Goblin controls, Boot dialog, and rules/help updates.
