### Feature Update: Polish & Persistence
- **Starting Heat Persist**: The "Starting Heat DC" is now a persistent House Rule setting in the sidebar, removing the need for a dialog popup every round.
- **Dared Logic**: Players who are "Dared" (forced action) will now see the cost of the required d8 as **"FREE"** in the UI.
- **Premium UI**: 
    - Buttons have been overhauled with the "Sword Coast Tavern" premium style (borders, textures, and hover glows).
    - NPC Wallet text is now highly legible with a dark background.
    - Skill Headers are now stylized and readable.
