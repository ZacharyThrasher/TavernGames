### Documentation: Truth in Rules Audit
- **Comprehensive Audit**: Reviewed the entire codebase to ensure `RULES.md` matches the *exact* runtime logic.
- **Clarifications**:
    - **Iron Liver**: Explicitly defined the DC formula (`10 + 2*Drinks`) and failure states (Sloppy vs Pass Out).
    - **Hunch**: Corrected DC (Code: 12, Old Rules: 15) and Nat 20/1 effects.
    - **Goad**: Clarified that the check is Intimidation/Persuasion vs Insight.
    - **Bump**: Clarified it uses a raw STR check (d20 + STR mod), not Athletics.
    - **Duel**: Documented the exact "Hit Count" tie-breaker formula.
