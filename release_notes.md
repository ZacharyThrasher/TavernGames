### AI Crew Manager UX + Duel Autoplay Fix
- Fixed autoplay behavior during duels: autoplay-enabled duel participants now auto-roll (`duelRoll`) correctly.
- Added a dedicated GM-only **AI Crew Manager** window for seat management and behavior tuning.
- Added **searchable NPC selection** with live name filtering when adding AI seats.
- Replaced cramped sidebar AI controls with a compact launcher that opens the manager window.
