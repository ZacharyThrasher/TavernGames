### Feature: Visual Feedback & Events
- **Results**: Skill cut-ins now display detailed result messages (e.g., "Player X bumped your die to a 2!").
- **Badges**: Added persistent status icons to player cards:
    - **DARED**: 🔥 (When under the effect of Goad)
    - **LOCKED**: 🔒 (When locked into a Bump Retaliation interaction)
    - **PROFILED**: 👁️ (When your secret has been read by another player)
- **Single Mode**: Improved cinematic overlay for single-target events to show both standard and target portraits.
