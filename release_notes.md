### AI Tavern Crew Expansion + Simulation Sandbox
- GM-only AI Crew panel now supports:
  - Add AI NPC seats with actor/name/wallet/playstyle/difficulty
  - Summon multiple AI NPCs in one action
  - Per-seat autoplay controls and AI seat removal
- Added new autoplay playstyles: `duelist`, `tactician`, `bully`.
- Added autoplay difficulty tiers: `easy`, `normal`, `hard`, `legendary` with behavior and pacing differences.
- Improved AI seat compatibility for non-user IDs (actor/name resolution + public dice attribution fallback).
- Added a full headless simulation sandbox under `simulations/` for balance and strategy iteration.
