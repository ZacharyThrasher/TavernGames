### Hotfix: Readability
- **Header Contrast**: Ante and Pot labels ("Ante:", "in the pot") are now light parchment color to read clearly against the dark wood header.
- **Turn Hint**: The "Betting Round: Choose your action!" hint text is now dark ink to read clearly against the light parchment alert box.
