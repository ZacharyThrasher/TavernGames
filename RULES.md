# Tavern Twenty-One - Rules

A dice gambling game for your D&D tavern scenes. Try to reach 21 without going over!

---

## Basic Rules

### Goal
Roll polyhedral dice to get as close to **21** as possible without going over.

### Setup
1. Players join the table and pay an **ante** (default: 5gp)
2. The GM starts the round

### Gameplay

**Opening Round**
- Each player rolls **2 dice** of their choice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20)
- These rolls are free

**Betting Round**
- Players take turns in order
- On your turn, choose to:
  - **Roll** another die (costs the ante amount)
  - **Hold** and keep your current total

**Busting**
- If your total exceeds 21, you **bust** and are out of the round
- Your dice are revealed immediately when you bust

### Winning
- After all players hold or bust, dice are revealed
- Highest total **21 or under** wins the pot
- Ties split the pot equally
- **Blackjack Bonus**: Hit exactly 21 (without cheating) to win **1.5x** your share

## Special Actions

### Cheat
*Sleight of Hand or Deception vs. passive Perception*

Secretly change one of your dice to any value you want.

- **Success**: Your cheated value stands (but you're marked as a cheater)
- **Failure**: You become a "bluffer" - you tried but got caught in the act

**Risk**: If accused during the Staredown, you lose your winnings and pay a penalty.

---

### Accuse
*During the Staredown phase only*

Point the finger at someone you suspect of cheating.

- **Cost**: Half the pot (paid upfront)
- **Correct**: The cheater is exposed, loses their winnings, and pays you a bounty
- **Wrong**: You lose your accusation fee and forfeit any winnings

---

### Intimidate
*Intimidation vs. Wisdom Save (or Insight)*

Force another player to hold immediately.

- **Success**: Target must hold and cannot roll again
- **Failure (Backfire)**: YOU must hold instead
- **Limit**: Once per round, per player
- **Cannot target**: Players who are already holding or busted

---

### Bump the Table
*Athletics vs. Dexterity Save*

Jostle the table to force an opponent to re-roll one of their dice.

- **Success**: You choose which of their dice gets re-rolled
- **Failure (Retaliation)**: THEY choose which of YOUR dice gets re-rolled
- **Limit**: Once per round, per player
- **Cannot target**: Yourself, the GM, or busted players
- **Can target**: Players who are holding (their held dice can still be bumped!)

## Tips

- **Low dice are safer** - A d4 can only add 1-4, making it hard to bust
- **High dice are riskier** - A d20 could win big or bust you instantly
- **Watch for cheaters** - If someone's total seems too perfect, they might be cheating
- **Intimidate strategically** - Force someone to hold when they're at a bad total
- **Bump the table** - Even players who are holding can have their dice bumped!

*May fortune favor the bold... and the clever.*
